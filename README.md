# cat-and-flowers-game

Little game that works over desktop. Made as a christmas gift.

To quit the game, finish the application via taskbar. You can focus on the game by clicking on the heart icon -- above the flowers.

This application was inspired by the work of rotten low (check [here](https://rnlw.itch.io/desktop-capybara)).
